  """A gradient tape that scales losses and unscales resulting gradients.

  Operates as a normal gradient tape, but takes in a
  `tf.train.experimental.LossScale` object. Losses are scaled up by some amount
  before the gradients are calculated and the resulting gradients are scaled
  down by the same amount.

  This has no net mathematical effect, but can be used to prevent vanishing
  gradients, for example in the case of mixed precision training.

  If a DynamicLossScale object is used and non-finite gradients are encountered,
  the loss scale will be updated and the gradients recomputed until either
  finite gradients are encountered or the loss scale becomes 1.

  This class should *not* be used with a LossScaleOptimizer, as both classes
  update the LossScale object. Use a non-loss scaling optimizer instead.

  Usage:
  ```
  opt = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(1.0)
  model_loss_scale = tf.train.experimental.DynamicLossScale()

  for step in training_steps:
    with LossScalingGradientTape(model_loss_scale) as tape:
      logits = ...  # Run model and get logits
      loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(logits=logits,
                                                     labels=labels)
      loss = tf.reduce_mean(loss)
    vars = tape.watched_variables()
    grads = tape.gradient(loss, vars)
    opt.apply_gradients(zip(grads, vars))

    Args:
      loss_scale: `tf.train.experimental.LossScale` object that

    Uses the `LossScale` object provided in the constructor to scale `target`

    Args:
      target: a list or nested structure of Tensors or Variables to be
